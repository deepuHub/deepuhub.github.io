# My Aeroponics Journey

## Introduction
Welcome to my blog where I share my exciting journey of growing plants using an aeroponics tower. I started this project with a DIY kit and have learned a lot along the way. Hereâ€™s a detailed account of my experience.

25-Jul-2024 | Sowed seeds in cocodisks
11-Aug-2024 | Placed spinach and coriander saplings in the aeroponics tower
12-Aug-2024 | Added nutrients to water in the tower as suggested in the manual. Maintained pH 350 to 400 ppm using the TDS meter provided in the kit
18-Aug-2024 | Placed cucumber saplings in the aeroponics tower
04-Sep-2024 | Added nutrients to water in the tower as suggested in the manual. Maintained pH 500 to 650 ppm using the TDS meter provided in the kit
08-Sep-2024 | Coriander was harvested
12-Sep-2024 | Cucumber flowers bloomed. Spinach was ready for harvest. Cleaned the tower and added fresh water and nutrients to pH 500 to 650 ppm


## Getting Started
1. **Purchasing the Kit**  
   I purchased the DIY kit from We Green Warriors. The kit came with full instructions on how to set up, including a QR scanner for video links.

3. **Setting Up the Tower**  
   I carefully followed the instructions provided in the kit to set up the tower. 

4. **Planting Seeds**  
   I planted seeds into the cocodisks as per the instructions.

5. **Transferring Saplings**  
   In two weeks, the saplings were ready to be transferred to the tower.

## Growing Experience
5. **Success with Coriander and Spinach**  
   Coriander was easy to grow, and spinach was successful as well. However, I was not able to get saplings from the other seeds provided, namely basil and lettuce.   

6. **Experimenting with Cucumber**  
   I purchased cucumber seeds from a local nursery, and they showed promise. I am currently waiting for the first cucumber. It got many flowers though.

7. **Harvesting Coriander & Spinach**  
   Spinach was ready for harvest in three months.
