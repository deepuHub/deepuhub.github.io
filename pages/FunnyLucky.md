### One of my friend, VLucky, writes jokes and ends them with #SmileWithLV. Some of them might be silly but sure they are gonna make you smile ;)

Wife: I have a bag full of used clothes I'd like to donate. 

Husband: Why not just throw it in the trash? That's much easier. 

Wife: But there are poor starving people who can really use all these clothes. 

Husband: Honey, anyone who fits into your clothes is definitely not starving. 

Now husband is starving ;)
