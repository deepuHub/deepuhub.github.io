### RN is our 4 year old boy. The amount of joy he brings to us in everyday life cannot be put to words in full. I will try to put few of the jokes he cracked consiously/unconsiously.  

Today in the temple there was small announcement that chikkappa was asked to make, the announcement room is small room that opens into a big hall that has speakers n Aaryan was looking from outside the room.
When chikkappa announced in the mike, RN said it seems 
" HAaaaa !! 
How come somebody is telling in speakers, the same thing that Chikkappa is telling here" 

I smiled happily after chikki told me this ðŸ˜€
