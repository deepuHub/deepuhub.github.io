I used Nexus4 phone for a year followed by Nexus5 for 3 years. 
Through these 4 years, I had minimum/repectable usablity knowledge of how things were shaping up in Mobile industry for Android, iOS and Windows.

My wife had a HTC Android phone and she moved to iPhone for good, seems like that for now. 

Frankly, I was not very careful in handling my Nexus5, I gave it a couple of plunges to concrete surface and many throws to the furniture/carpet over time. 
And I dont believe in having clothes/cases for my phones (*unless you have kids without clothes*)  

As my pretty Nexus5's battery started draining fast and hot, I restrained myself from buying a new phone in hopes of a better phone (*may be even forseeing the convergence of Laptop and Mobile*) like [ARA](https://atap.google.com/ara/), a Windows UWP wireless Continuum like phone or an Ubuntu (*may be I was thinking wild*)

Frankly, I wrote this post to answer myself more than anyone else, because **I use what I Love**. 

Reminds me of [Steve Litchfield's](http://allaboutwindowsphone.com/authors/steve-litchfield.php) article ['Ignore the haters, use what you love'](http://allaboutwindowsphone.com/flow/item/22361_Ignore_the_haters_use_what_you.php)
