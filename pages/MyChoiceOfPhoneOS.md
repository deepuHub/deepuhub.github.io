I used Nexus4 phone for a year followed by Nexus5 for 3 years. 
Through these 4 years, I had minimum/repectable usablity knowledge of how things were shaping up in Mobile industry for Android, iOS and Windows.

My wife had a HTC Android phone and she moved to iPhone for good, seems like that for now. 

Frankly, I was not very careful in handling my Nexus5, I gave it a couple of plunges to concrete and many throws to the furniture/carpet over time. 
And I dont believe in having clothes/cases for my phones (*unless you have kids without clothes*)
