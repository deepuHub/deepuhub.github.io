I used Nexus4 phone for a year followed by Nexus5 for 3 years. 
Through these 4 years, I had minimum/repectable usablity knowledge of how things were shaping up in Mobile industry for Android, iOS and Windows.

My wife had a HTC Android phone and she moved to iPhone for good, seems like that for now. 

Frankly, I was not very careful in handling my Nexus5, I gave it a couple of plunges to concrete surface and many throws to the furniture/carpet over time. 
And I dont believe in having clothes/cases for my phones (*unless you have kids without clothes*)  

As my pretty Nexus5's battery started draining fast and hot, I restrained myself from buying a new phone in hopes of a better phone (*may be even forseeing the convergence of Laptop and Mobile*) like [ARA](https://atap.google.com/ara/), a Windows UWP wireless Continuum phone or an Ubuntu for that matter. 

So my Nexus5 battery gave me less of battery (*with moderate to less usage, by evening 5 it had less than 20% left*) and had speaker problems, so I took my better half's iPhone6 (*dont worry she had an iPhone7 by then* ) 

Spotlight | My iPhone6 | My Nexus5 | My Choice | Additional Comments 
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
Keyboard | Though predictive typing enables faster typing than conventional, for me its not advanced. | GBoard is so quick for swipe typing with # of quick tricks and it supports typing in my native languages and with ease  | My Nexus5 | This is the major drawback I found in no time, In fact, I could not imagine typing on a smartphone without having swipe feature. I tried typing the same sentence with Predictive typing (2m14s) and GBoard (1m14s), may be I have less practice with predictive but I didn't understand why would I need to lift my fingers after every letter and then lift again and choose the predicted word on the Top ribbon. 
Size && Grip (No cases and 1 hand yo..) | Very good and fits easily in pockets && for me its slippery(*may be it's #13 element in the periodic table*) and could barely reach to the top of the screen Â± typing, triggers usage of both hands | Decent enough && good grip, most of the navigation can be achieved as the controls are on the bottom and typing with single hand is possible but not comfortable. I tend to use my other hand just to give support to the top of the phone | My iPhone6 | So for comfortable usage I need to use both my hands with either of the phones, though I felt iPhone6 screen is less for me

Frankly, I wrote this post to answer myself more than anyone else.
